# MS Access Export

Dumps CSVs from an Access Database. Written in jython. There is probably
some unpleasant set-up work involved in getting it to work on any given
computer.

`./setup.sh` will download most, if not all of the prerequisite JARs,
at least.

## Usage

`./setup.sh`

`./exportDb.py` to run using GUI file choosers

`./exportDb.py -h` to view command line options (which, when used, disable the GUI file choosers)
